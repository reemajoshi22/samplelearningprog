/*Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details and 
describing things in simple terms. 
For example, a method that adds two integers.
The method internal processing is hidden from outer world. 
There are many ways to achieve abstraction in object oriented programming, 
such as encapsulation and inheritance.*/
/* Abstract Class- is declared with abstract keyword.abstract class may or may not
have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods.A method defined abstract
must always be redefined in the subclass,
thus making overriding compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract.
There can be no object of an abstract class.
That is, an abstract class can not be directly 
instantiated with the new operator.*/
